## Vercel & Flask Quantum Gaussian Wave Packet Propagation Simulations

This website, developed for PHYS-495 (senior final project) at the University of Southern California, showcases interactive simulations created by Emilia Doda, a physics and computer science student. This website acts as an educational supplement to visually enrich the learning of undergraduate-level quantum mechanics, with a focus on illustrating the principles of quantum tunneling and Gaussian wave packets.

How to run the Github project locally:
1. Clone the Github repository.
2. In terminal, type: 
    1. source venv/bin/activate
    2. export FLASK_APP=[index.py](http://index.py/)
    3. export FLASK_ENV=development
    4. flask run
3. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (5000 is the default port used by Flask).
