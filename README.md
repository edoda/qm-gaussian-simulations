## React & Flask Quantum Gaussian Wave Packet Propagation Simulations

This website, originally developed for PHYS-495 (senior final project) at the University of Southern California, showcases interactive simulations created by Emilia Doda, a physics and computer science student. This website acts as an educational supplement to visually enrich the learning of undergraduate-level quantum mechanics, with a focus on illustrating the principles of quantum tunneling and Gaussian wave packets.
